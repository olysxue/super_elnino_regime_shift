## üîç Climate Regime Shift Detection Steps

The regime shift detection algorithm identifies statistically significant and persistent changes in the mean state of a climate variable (e.g., SST, SAT, soil moisture or sea ice).  
The method follows the **Sequential t-test Analysis of Regime Shifts (STARS)** framework (Rodionov 2004) with optional bootstrap confidence testing.

---

### **Step 1: Input Data**
- Load an anomaly time series (monthly or annual) of the target variable.  
- The series should be detrended.  
- Input can be either:
  - 1D (time series of regional mean), or  
  - 3D (time‚Äìlat‚Äìlon field for gridwise detection).

This method enables the identification of climate regime shifts (CRSs) in a purely data-driven manner, without requiring prior assumptions regarding the timing or number of shifts.

---

### **Step 2: Apply Pre-Filtering (Optional)**
- Smooth or band-pass filter the data to remove high-frequency variability (e.g., 2‚Äì8 day or interseasonal noise).
- Filtering is optional but recommended when focusing on decadal-scale CRSs.
---

### **Step 3: Define a Moving Window**
- Specify a window length `L` (usually 10 years for climate applications).  
- The algorithm compares the mean of the **current regime** with that of a **candidate new regime** `L` points ahead.
- 
---

### **Step 4: Perform Sequential t-Tests**
For each time t:
1. Compute the mean of two segments of length `L` (before and after t).  
2. Apply a two-sample Student‚Äôs t-test to test for a significant difference in means.  
3. If |t-statistic| > critical value (p < threshold), a potential shift is detected.

---

### **Step 5: Confirm Persistence**
- The detected shift must persist for at least `L` subsequent points with the same sign of anomaly.  
- Otherwise it is classified as a transient fluctuation and discarded.

#### üßÆ Regime Shift Index (RSI)
To verify persistence quantitatively, the **Regime Shift Index (RSI)** is calculated as the **cumulative sum of normalized anomalies** relative to the previous regime mean:

$$
\mathrm{RSI}(t)=\sum_{i=1}^{t}\frac{x_i-\bar{x}_{\mathrm{ref}}}{\sigma_{\mathrm{ref}}}
$$

**where:**
- **x<sub>i</sub>** ‚Äî value of the variable at time step *i* (e.g., SST anomaly, SAT anomaly, soil moisture anomaly)  
- **xÃÑ<sub>ref</sub>** ‚Äî mean value of the previous (reference) regime  
- **œÉ<sub>ref</sub>** ‚Äî standard deviation within the previous regime, used for normalization  
- **t** ‚Äî time index (in years, months, or time steps, depending on input)  
- **RSI(t)** ‚Äî cumulative index indicating the direction and strength of the regime shift  

A shift is confirmed when the RSI crosses zero and remains non-zero for at least cut-off length `L`, indicating a sustained departure from the prior mean state.  

**Interpretation**
- **Positive RSI ‚Üí** persistent shift toward higher mean values
- **Negative RSI ‚Üí** persistent shift toward lower mean values  
- The **magnitude** of RSI reflects both the strength and duration of the deviation.  

RSI complements the t-test by capturing the cumulative persistence of anomalies, making it especially useful for identifying decadal or multi-decadal transitions.

---

### **Step 6: Update Regime Mean**
- Once a significant and persistent shift is confirmed,  
  - Update the reference mean to the new regime.  
  - Record the shift year, mean difference, and significance level.

---

### **Typical Output**
| Variable | Description |
|-----------|--------------|
| `shift_years` | Years when significant regime changes occur |
| `mean_before`, `mean_after` | Means of two adjacent regimes |
| `t_value`, `p_value` | Test statistics |
| `persistence` | Boolean indicating sustained shift |

---

### **Example Interpretation**
A 10-year moving-window test applied to 1958‚Äì2024 SST anomalies may identify persistent regime shifts in:
- **1976‚Äì77:** Pacific climate transition,  
- **1998:** Post-Super El Ni√±o cooling phase,  
- **2016:** Recent Super El Ni√±o-induced shift toward a new warming regime.

# üìà Regime Shift Occurrence Probability Calculation

To enhance the statistical robustness of the regime shift analysis, Climate Regime Shifts (CRSs) were detected in both **observational** and **climate model** datasets, for:
- **Annual mean**, and  
- **Four meteorological seasons:**  
  - **DJF** (December‚ÄìFebruary)  
  - **MAM** (March‚ÄìMay)  
  - **JJA** (June‚ÄìAugust)  
  - **SON** (September‚ÄìNovember)

---

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Grid-level CRS Probability**

For each grid cell, the total probability of CRS occurrence is computed as:

$$
\mathrm{Prob}_t(x,y) = \frac{n(x,y)}{T}
$$

where:
- **n(x,y)** ‚Äî number of years in which a regime shift was detected at grid location *(x, y)*  
- **T** ‚Äî total number of years in the time series  

---

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Super El Ni√±o‚ÄìInduced CRS Probability**

To quantify the specific influence of **Super El Ni√±o (SE)** events, the CRS probability due to Super El Ni√±o is defined as:

$$
\mathrm{Prob}_{SE}(x,y) = \frac{n_{SE}(x,y)}{T_{SE}}
$$

where:
- **n<sub>SE</sub>(x,y)** ‚Äî number of regime shifts detected during Super El Ni√±o development or following years  
- **T<sub>SE</sub>** ‚Äî total number of Super El Ni√±o years (e.g., 1982‚Äì83, 1997‚Äì98, 2015‚Äì16 in observations)

The enhanced CRS probability associated with Super El Ni√±o is calculated as:

$$
\Delta \mathrm{Prob}(x,y) = \mathrm{Prob}_{SE}(x,y) - \mathrm{Prob}_t(x,y)
= \frac{n_{SE}(x,y)}{T_{SE}} - \frac{n(x,y)}{T}
$$

This provides a spatial and seasonal map of **Super El Ni√±o‚Äìinduced regime shift enhancement**.

---

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Ensemble Aggregation (CESM2-LE)**

In CESM2-LE, regime-shift detection is performed for each of the 100 ensemble members.  
The occurrence probabilities are then **aggregated across all members** to improve robustness and reduce internal variability noise.

---

### **4Ô∏è‚É£ Global and Latitudinal Integration**

To obtain an integrated **global probability** view, the annual CRS probability is computed with **latitude weighting**:

$$
\mathrm{Prob}(i) = 
\frac{\int_{-\pi/2}^{\pi/2} \cos\phi \, n(i,\phi) \, d\phi}
{\int_{-\pi/2}^{\pi/2} \cos\phi \, N(\phi) \, d\phi}
$$

where:
- **n(i,œÜ)** ‚Äî number of CRSs detected at latitude œÜ during year *i*  
- **N(œÜ)** ‚Äî number of grid cells at latitude œÜ  
- **cosœÜ weighting** ‚Äî ensures accurate area representation across latitudes

This latitude-weighted integration provides a globally consistent estimate of the temporal evolution of CRS occurrence probabilities.

---

### üßÆ Summary
- Detect regime shifts (annual and seasonal) for each grid cell  
- Calculate total and SE-specific CRS probabilities  
- Aggregate ensemble members for robustness  
- Compute latitude-weighted global CRS probability time series  

These steps together quantify **how and where Super El Ni√±o events statistically increase the probability of climate regime shifts**.
