## üîç Climate Regime Shift Detection Steps

The regime shift detection algorithm identifies statistically significant and persistent changes in the mean state of a climate variable (e.g., SST, SAT, soil moisture or sea ice).  
The method follows the **Sequential t-test Analysis of Regime Shifts (STARS)** framework (Rodionov 2004) with optional bootstrap confidence testing.

---

### **Step 1: Input Data**
- Load an anomaly time series (monthly or annual) of the target variable.  
- The series should be detrended.  
- Input can be either:
  - 1D (time series of regional mean), or  
  - 3D (time‚Äìlat‚Äìlon field for gridwise detection).

This method enables the identification of climate regime shifts (CRSs) in a purely data-driven manner, without requiring prior assumptions regarding the timing or number of shifts.

---

### **Step 2: Apply Pre-Filtering (Optional)**
- Smooth or band-pass filter the data to remove high-frequency variability (e.g., 2‚Äì8 day or interseasonal noise).
- Filtering is optional but recommended when focusing on decadal-scale CRSs.
---

### **Step 3: Define a Moving Window**
- Specify a window length `L` (usually 10 years for climate applications).  
- The algorithm compares the mean of the **current regime** with that of a **candidate new regime** `L` points ahead.
- 
---

### **Step 4: Perform Sequential t-Tests**
For each time t:
1. Compute the mean of two segments of length `L` (before and after t).  
2. Apply a two-sample Student‚Äôs t-test to test for a significant difference in means.  
3. If |t-statistic| > critical value (p < threshold), a potential shift is detected.

---

### **Step 5: Confirm Persistence**
- The detected shift must persist for at least `L` subsequent points with the same sign of anomaly.  
- Otherwise it is classified as a transient fluctuation and discarded.

#### üßÆ Regime Shift Index (RSI)
To verify persistence quantitatively, the **Regime Shift Index (RSI)** is calculated as the **cumulative sum of normalized anomalies** relative to the previous regime mean:

$$
\mathrm{RSI}(t)=\sum_{i=1}^{t}\frac{x_i-\bar{x}_{\mathrm{ref}}}{\sigma_{\mathrm{ref}}}
$$

**where:**
- **x<sub>i</sub>** ‚Äî value of the variable at time step *i* (e.g., SST anomaly, SAT anomaly, soil moisture anomaly)  
- **xÃÑ<sub>ref</sub>** ‚Äî mean value of the previous (reference) regime  
- **œÉ<sub>ref</sub>** ‚Äî standard deviation within the previous regime, used for normalization  
- **t** ‚Äî time index (in years, months, or time steps, depending on input)  
- **RSI(t)** ‚Äî cumulative index indicating the direction and strength of the regime shift  

A shift is confirmed when the RSI crosses zero and remains non-zero for at least `L` time steps, indicating a sustained departure from the prior mean state.  

**Interpretation**
- **Positive RSI ‚Üí** persistent shift toward higher mean values
- **Negative RSI ‚Üí** persistent shift toward lower mean values  
- The **magnitude** of RSI reflects both the strength and duration of the deviation.  

RSI complements the t-test by capturing the cumulative persistence of anomalies, making it especially useful for identifying decadal or multi-decadal transitions.

---

### **Step 6: Update Regime Mean**
- Once a significant and persistent shift is confirmed,  
  - Update the reference mean to the new regime.  
  - Record the shift year, mean difference, and significance level.

---

### **Typical Output**
| Variable | Description |
|-----------|--------------|
| `shift_years` | Years when significant regime changes occur |
| `mean_before`, `mean_after` | Means of two adjacent regimes |
| `t_value`, `p_value` | Test statistics |
| `persistence` | Boolean indicating sustained shift |

---

### **Example Interpretation**
A 10-year moving-window test applied to 1958‚Äì2024 SST anomalies may identify persistent regime shifts in:
- **1976‚Äì77:** Pacific climate transition,  
- **1998:** Post-Super El Ni√±o cooling phase,  
- **2016:** Recent Super El Ni√±o-induced shift toward a new warming regime.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Workflow Summary

1. **Detection** ‚Äì Apply the STARS algorithm to identify significant and persistent mean-state shifts for each grid point or region.   
3. **Probability Calculation** ‚Äì  
   - Count the **number of regime-shift occurrences** at each grid cell.   
   - Compute probabilities separately for:  
     - **Super El Ni√±o (SE) years** (e.g., 1982/83, 1997/98, 2015/16)  
     - **Regular El Ni√±o years**  
     - **Climatological mean (non-El Ni√±o) years**  
   - Output includes spatial maps and temporal evolution of regime shift shift frequency and SE vs non-SE differences.

## üß† Notes

- Users can modify the window length (**L**) and significance level (**p**) within each script header.  
All scripts are **modular** and can be easily adapted to different climate variables or datasets.
